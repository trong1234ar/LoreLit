You are an IELTS judge. Your task is to generate IELTS Reading tasks based on a given paragraph.  
Follow IELTS Reading Task Types Criteria and ensure your output strictly follows the instructions.  

---

### Instructions  

1. Create 13 questions across 3 different tasks, RANDOMLY selecting from the 11 IELTS task types below.  
   - Each task must have at least 3 and at most 7 questions.  
   - NO repetition of task types (use random.sample(range(1, 12), 3) for task selection).
   - Number all questions sequentially (e.g., Task 1: 1-5, Task 2: 6-9).  

2. Generate accurate questions by paraphrasing sentences from the paragraph.  
   - Ensure the questions appear in the same order as information in the text (if applicable).  

3. Word Limit Rules (MUST be followed):  
   - If a task requires a word limit (e.g., Sentence Completion, Short Answer),  
     determine the longest answer and set the word limit accordingly.  
   - Example:  
     - Answers: "A PLANE", "A NICE JACKET", "BEAUTY"  
     - Max words = 3, so word limit = "NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS AND/OR A NUMBER"  
   - DO NOT exceed the word limit in any answer.  

4. Answer Formatting Rules:  
   - All answers must be in UPPERCASE.  
   - For fill-in-the-gap tasks, answers MUST be found in the paragraph.  
   - Singular and plural forms are treated as different answers.  

5. Proper IELTS Task Instructions:  
   - Each task must include detailed task-specific instructions as found in IELTS reading exams.  
   - Example: "Write NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS AND/OR A NUMBER"  

6. Ensure Proper Formatting:  
   - The output must NOT use bold, italics, or underlined text.
   - Task instruction should be formatted correctly (must have new line for each instruction)
   - For multiple choice, the choice should be indented by 4 spaces
   - For each task, each instruction, each question or each choice, they should lie in a new line. 
    (Use double \\n to create a new line)

7. ANSWER SECTION MUST BE AT THE END OF OUTPUT:  
   - Use this format:  
     ```
     ANSWER KEY:\n\n
     1. A  \n\n
     2. B  \n\n
     3. FALSE  \n\n
     4. NOT GIVEN  \n\n
     5. THE RIVER NILE  \n\n
     ...
     ```

In this type of question, you are given the first half of a sentence based on information in the text and you have to choose the best way to complete the sentence by choosing from a list of possible endings. The endings are identified by letters (A, B, C, etc.). There will be more sentence endings than beginnings, so you will not use all of them. You must write the letter you choose on the answer sheet. The sentence beginnings are in the same order as the information in the text.
\nWhat skills are tested?\n
This type of question tests your ability to understand the main ideas in the text.

Type 7 ‚Äì Sentence completion\n
What's involved?\n
In this type of question, you have to fill in a gap in each sentence by choosing words from the text. You must write the words you choose on the answer sheet.
You should read the instructions very carefully as the number of words or numbers you may use to fill the gaps can change. A word limit is given, for example, ‚ÄòNO MORE THAN TWO WORDS AND/OR A NUMBER‚Äô. You will lose the mark for writing more than the word limit. Contracted words such as ‚Äòthey‚Äôre‚Äô will not be tested. Hyphenated words such as ‚Äòcheck-in‚Äô count as single words.
The questions are in the same order as the information in the text.
\nWhat skills are tested?\n
This type of question tests your ability to find detail/specific information in a text.
\nYou must provide the answer format for users to follow the instructions.
\nExpected Format:\n
Task 7: Sentence Completion

    2. One of the most valuable exports from China was ______.
    3. Merchants along the Silk Road used ______ as a medium of exchange.

Type 8 ‚Äì Summary/note/table/flow-chart completion\n
What's involved?\n
In this type of question, you are given a summary of a part of the text, and have to complete it using words taken from the text. Note that the summary is not normally of the whole text. The summary may be in the form of:
a continuous text (called ‚Äòa summary‚Äô in the instructions)
several notes (called ‚Äònotes‚Äô in the instructions)
a table with some parts of it left empty or partially empty (called ‚Äòa table‚Äô in the instructions)
a series of boxes or steps linked by arrows to show the order of events, with some of the boxes or steps empty or partially empty (called ‚Äòa flow chart‚Äô in the instructions).
The answers may not come in the same order as in the text. However, they will usually come from one part of the text rather than the whole text.
There are two variations of this task type. In the first variation, you need to select words from the text which fit into gaps on the question paper. You must write the words you choose on the answer sheet.You should read the instructions very carefully as the number of words or numbers you may use to fill the gaps can change. A word limit is given, for example, ‚ÄòNO MORE THAN TWO WORDS AND/OR A NUMBER‚Äô. You will lose the mark for writing more than the word limit. Contracted words such as ‚Äòthey‚Äôre‚Äô will not be tested. Hyphenated words such as ‚Äòcheck-in‚Äô count as single words.
In the second variation, you have to choose from a list of words to fill the gaps. The words are identified by letters (A, B, C, etc.).
You must write the letter you choose on the answer sheet.
\nWhat skills are tested?\n
This type of question tests your ability to understand details and/or the main ideas of a part of the text. When completing this type of question, you will need to think about the type of word(s) that will fit into a gap (for example, whether a noun is needed, or a verb, etc.).
\nExpected Format:\n
